# Student Pygame Projects

Used for developing school projects with the pygame library in Python.

## Setting up your pygame environment

1. Create a folder in your documents named `pygame`.
2. Open up Visual Studio Code with the official Microsoft Python extensions installed. If you have not done this, visit the [Getting Started With VS Code Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PV7QZJSrFGWCX3ZkHzgSUKDeOvkqwWfj_sHOzagDPkM/view) to get set up.
3. On the top left, click file, then open folder, and choose your `pygame` folder.
4. Press Cmd (Ctrl for Windows) + \` (grave) to open up a terminal in this folder.
5. Type the following to create a Python environment for this project: `python3 -m venv env` for Mac/Linux or `python -m venv env` for Windows.
6. After some time, you should see another folder in your file navigation called env, which contains all the files for your Python environment. To ensure it activates, close terminal.
7. Reopen terminal and VS Code should pick up your environment. It should say your virtual environment's name at the beginning of the terminal line.
8. type the following to install pygame: `pip3 install pygame` for Mac/Linux or `pip install pygame` for Windows.
9. Create a new file from VS Code's file explorer, and name it as `main.py`.
10. Copy the boilerplate code in this repository to your file. You are now set up! Click run to test if everything works!
